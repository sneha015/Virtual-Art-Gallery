# Virtual-Art-Gallery

Virtual Art Gallery is an Augmented Reality Android mobile application, developed using Unity 3D, Vuforia SDK and Android Studio. 

If you want to buy a painting or a sculpture or center piece for your tea table from an artist across the world, 
you can do so online through several e-commerce websites that sells art works. 

But how do you decide, if the painting goes well with the interiors of your house? how big would the art work be on your wall ? 

Virtual Art Gallery is the one stop solution, which lets you virtually view the painting on your wall with its actual size and 
see how that center piece looks on your corner table or see how well the garden sculpture goes with the landscape of your front yard!

You can download and install the application from Google play store , it comes with a trigger image which should be color printed 
full size on an A4 sheet, paste the trigger image on wall where you want to try painting, or place it on table where you want to see 
the sculpture. open the app, browse through all the paintings and sculptures, click on them to see the Augmented reality camera launching, 
now point the camera on the trigger image to see the art work virtually appear on it.
